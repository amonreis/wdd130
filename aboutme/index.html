    <h2 class="name">Amon Reis</h2>
    <p>My name is Amon Reis, some friends(RM) used to call me "Koki" which is short for "Kokimoto", a japanese character from a brazilian tv show. I believe that was because I served a mission in Japan and I have slanted eyes.</p>
    <p>I'm pursuing a Bachelor's of Applied Technology because I love computers. Actually, I was never good with technology, but over time I learned to like it and now I juts love it. Not knowing how to even turn on a computer in the past made me want to learn everything about computers.</p>
    <p>I love sports, especially volleyball, table tennis, and of course soccer. I also like to spend time with my wife (she's my family) and watch movies and series. Programming became one of my favorite hobbies as well. I enjoy studying languages.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church since I was born. I love a scripture in Ether in the Book of Mormon, it's Ether 12:27. I love this scripture because I felt that way (weak) several times during my life. Especially when I was serving a mission, as I invited people to come unto Christ, I could see that I was coming closer to Him. The more I got to know Him and the more I would seek Him through prayer, study and faith the more I felt that there still were many things I needed to change. However I was feeling strong and I felt like I could do anything with Him.</p>
    <p>I am married to the most beautiful, amazing and caring woman in the world. I love her!</p>
    <p>I am very excited to learn more of computer science and looking forward for this class and to learning from each of you :D.</p>
