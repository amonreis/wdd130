      <p>Welcome to Everyday Japanese!</p> 
      <p>Our purpose is to help you build a solid foundation in Japanese by learning keywords and basic grammar in a very natural and simple way that will help you hold an everyday conversation in Japanese. If you've ever been one of those who have spent hours in front of a computer doing research to understand a concept or have a question solved, or if you're just tired of taking paid courses or you can't even afford one.</p>
      <p>We help you better organize your studies by providing different ways to study the contents of the site. You can choose to study by topic, if you want to learn through examples in certain situations like conversations at home, school, work, market, mall, hotel, airport, etc., you can choose to study that way. You can also study by vocabulary topics like food, human body parts, transportation, clothing, etc., and grammatical structures like pronouns, articles, possessives, verb conjugation, etc.</p>
      <p>The site is full of examples for each topic, grammar, and vocabulary, so you can have a more stimulating and inspiring experience.</p>
      <p>Before you really get started studying all of Japanese, something very important that you should be aware of is that there are Japanese proficiency levels as well as a world-well-known and recognized test to measure the proficiency level of non-native learners of Japanese. It is called JLPT, Japanese Language Proficiency Test. The JLPT has five levels: N1, N2, N3, N4, and N5. The easiest level is N5, and the most difficult level is N1. N4 and N5 measure the level of understanding of basic Japanese mainly learned in class. N1 and N2 measure the level of understanding of Japanese used in a broad range of scenes in actual everyday life. N3 is a bridging level between N1/N2 and N4/N5.</p>
      <p>The focus of this site is to help you have an N4 Japanese.</p>
      <p>We wish you the best on your journey, happy studying!</p>
